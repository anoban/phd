  title = {Testing for phylogenetic signal in comparative data: behavioral traits
	are more labile},
  journal = {Evolution},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {57},
  pages = {717--745},
  abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical
	methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species
	to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is
	true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question,
	but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal
	are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued
	characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent
	contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization
	procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of
	similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I
	error rate at a nominal alpha = 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated
	datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive
	statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic
	signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically
	motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
	(OU) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model
	in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate (ACDC)
	in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation).
	Maximum likelihood estimation of the OU (d) and ACDC (g) parameters
	can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of
	d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical
	structure (a star) offers a good fit to the data. Transformations
	that improve the fit of a tree to comparative data will increase
	power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for
	further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution.
	Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that,
	for trees with 20 or more species, 92% of traits exhibited significant
	phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and
	ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily
	malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong
	environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement
	error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size,
	on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology,
	branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K
	was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or
	measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates
	of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance
	of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral
	traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history,
	or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected
	for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For
	trees with 20 or more species, the estimated OU (25% of traits) and/or
	ACDC (40%) transformation parameter differed significantly from both
	zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or
	occasionally more) structure than the original better fit the data
	and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

  abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play
	a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical
	forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological
	community can provide insights into the relative importance of different
	processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study
	were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest
	tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado
	Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree
	communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP,
	and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community
	phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure
	for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from
	10 X 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure
	by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the
	distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated
	using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain
	observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom
	community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null
	model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities,
	the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP
	was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats
	than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered
	or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats.
	In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically
	clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their
	neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats
	were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more
	distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic
	clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of
	phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats,
	but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has
	several possible explanations, including variation in the strength
	of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history
	of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will
	need to include information on species traits in order to explain
	the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical
	forests.},

	differentiation, mass effects, dispersal limitation), and local biotic
	interactions (e.g., density dependence, resource competition; summarized
	in Fig. 1; see chapters X, Y, Z). These assembly processes are mediated
	by the phenotypic similarities or differences of individuals which
	are the outcome of evolutionary change in historical communities,
	and ultimately the composition of taxa in a regional species pool
	is the outcome of biogeographic processes. Given the great diversity
	of tropical tree species, we are unlikely to ever know enough about
	the ecologically important phenotypes or pre- cise spatial ranges
	of species to be able to predict local community species composition
	based on detailed attributes of every species. However, we suggest
	in this chapter that be- cause species similarity and difference
	are strongly influenced by common ancestry, as is the presence or
	absence of a taxonomic clade in a geographic area, a phylogenetic
	approach may be most effective for understanding and predicting local
	community composition. In this chapter, we thus briefly review current
	understanding of abiotic and biotic con- trols of local species composition,
	and of evolutionary patterns in ecological character. We then describe
	phylogenetic analyses which explore the outcomes of neighborhood
	in- teractions, habitat filtering, climatic gradients and biogeographic
	history by analyzing the phylogenetic patterns of species composition
	at nested spatial scales (Fig. 1). We test these methods with data
	from forests in Southeast Asia. Finally, we discuss the association
	of ecological and biogeographic characteristics with internal nodes
	of plant phylogenies and the creation of predictive models for the
	general taxonomic and ecological composition of communities.},

        phylogenetic query tool where users submit a list of taxa (e.g. from
        an ecological community), with modern family and genus names, and
        which returns a phylogenetic hypothesis for the relationships among
        taxa. Any set of stored phylogenies, or a user-supplied one, can
        be chosen as the basis for the returned phylogeny, and several output
        formats for the tree can be selected. Currently, the source databases
        cover seed plants.},
